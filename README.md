# US-National-Park-Visitation

The US National Parks are an amazing resource we have available to us, full of unique landscapes and abundant wildlife. For this project, I analyzed the visitation trends of all 63 US National Parks. Where is each park located? How has overall visitation changed over time? Have major moments in history had an effect on visitation? Which parks are the most visited? Which parks are the least visited? Does seasonality affect visitation? Which parks are the most visited in the summer/spring/winter/fall? How does each parkâ€™s seasonal visitation compare to the overall average for that time of year? All of these questions can be answered by interacting with this dashboard.

Included is the Python notebook to pre process the data as well as the Tableau Packaged Workbook. 

The final dashboard is located here on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lauren.jachimczyk/viz/USNationalParksVisitation_17149407448230/USNationalParks
